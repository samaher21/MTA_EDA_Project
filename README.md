# MTA_EDA_Project
## INTRODUCTION:

Every day millions of residents and visitors of NEW YORK city flood the subway system as their primary means of transportation throughout the city. And every station for the subway system named the MTA, is a high traffic area, which is optimal for interfacing with a large number of people. Therefore, the presence of a souvenirâ€™s shops inside these stations, facilitates and helps residents and visitors to buy while they are inside the station.

## PROBLEM AND SOLUTION (QUESTION):

the presence of a souvenir shop in metro stations is due to several reasons: the most important of which is the increase in the percentage of sales and profits for the company due to the presence of large numbers of residents and visitors and saving time for and visitors in an easier and faster way.

## DATA DESCRIPTIN:

To start the project, I need to add and read the data in the MTA during the summer period from June to September 2019 for use, such as: (C/A, unit, SCP, station, line name, etc.). 
For example:
Time: I need to know the most time and hours when there are large numbers of visitors at the station.
Station: Find out the most crowded stations and many tourists.

## TOOLS: 

Use Anaconda, Jupyter, python language.
Use many libraries in python like (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, math).
