# Observation:


This is the final bar chart that shows us which station has the maximum traffic. We could notice that both stations that are located in Midtown Manhattan (GRO CNTRL-42 ST , 34 ST-PENN STA) in blue and orange colors have an approximated equal maximum Daily entry which means highest traffic among other stations, so both are the best stations to place our business stand in order to increase our revinues. On the other hand, stations ( 34 ST-HEARALD SQ, 23 ST) in green and red colors which are located in Hearald SQ and Flatiron District of Manhattan have the second place in traffic volumes ammounts.Finally, Pathe New WTC station that is located in Financial District of Manhattan has the third place in daily traffic.
